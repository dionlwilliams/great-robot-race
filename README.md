# great-robot-race

This project was one I worked on as part of Codecademy's Intermediate Python 3 course, and was designed to expand upon the use of advanced containers. While some background code was provided in the robot-race-functions.py file, the robot_race.py file consists of a large majority of my code. This project really helped to cement the syntax of many Python containers, and to see how these can be used practically in a meaningful way.
